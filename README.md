## 🛠️ Installation
### Prerequisites

   1. Python 3.8 or higher

   2. pip package manager

### Steps

   1. Clone or download this project

   2. Install required dependencies:
    
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ⚙️ Configuration

### The application automatically saves your settings in config/settings.json, including:

   * Last used image path

   * Scale factor preference

   * Movable overlay setting

   * Overlay position coordinates

   * Enabled/disabled state

## 🔧 Customization

### To create your own overlay images:

   * Use an image editor that supports transparency (like Photoshop, GIMP, or Photopea)

   * Save your image as PNG with alpha channel transparency

   * Transparent areas will show the underlying applications

   * Opaque areas will display your overlay content

## 🐛 Troubleshooting
### Common Issues

   * Overlay not appearing: Ensure you've checked "Enable Overlay"

   * Image not loading: Check that the image path is correct and the file exists

   * Click-through not working: This is platform-dependent and works best on Windows

### Transparency Tips

   * Use PNG images with proper alpha channels for best results

   * The application uses a gray color (#808080) for transparency masking

   * Avoid using this exact gray color in your overlay images
